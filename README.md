# RMap

**WIP!**

![CI build](https://github.com/dadhi/RMap/actions/workflows//rust.yml/badge.svg)


Eventually... it will be the Fast Immutable Map in Rust, 
initially based on my [ImTools ImHashMap](https://github.com/dadhi/ImTools) with 2-3 trees under the hood.

Today it is me learning and playing with rust.
